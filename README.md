# Analysis-of-Bike-related-Purchases
Analysis of dataset from a bike-specializing client.

To better enhance my skills, I participated in the KPMG data analytics virtual internship and analysed the data gotten from a bike-specializing client. I was provided with 3 datasets consisting of the Customer demographic, Customer addresses and Transcations data for the past 3 months and started-off by assessing data quality. I performed a preliminary data exploration to identify ways to improve the quality of the data, after which I identified the data quality issues, and strategies to alleviate the issues.

After I assessed the data quality, I prepared a power point presentation to showcase my understanding of the dataset (data exploration), data transformation, model development and interpretation. 

Finally, for data preparation, I created reports using visualizations to develop a #simple dashboard and highlighted key findings as to which new customers the client should target.
